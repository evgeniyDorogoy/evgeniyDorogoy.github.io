### Preface
If you've ever found yourself driving through Germany with a car registered in a non-EU country, you may have 
encountered the daunting task of legalizing it. While there are countless guides online that offer vague advice 
such as "get a CoC from the dealer" or "pass a technical inspection at TÃœV," 
these resources often leave you with more questions than answers. These tips are not particularly helpful when you 
don't know where to start or what to expect.

In this article, I aim to provide a detailed account of my own experience with car registration in Germany. 
Rather than simply explaining the theoretical process, I'll provide concrete examples of what to do, 
including which documents to prepare, what they should look like, which authorities to visit, and what you can 
expect as a result. 

Certainly, each experience is unique, and your case may differ from mine. It's important to note that my experience 
with car registration in Germany was specific to my circumstances (let's call it the context), 
which I will outline below.

### Context
I have registered a Mazda 6 GJ with a diesel engine, which was previously imported into Ukraine by 
an official importer. The car has its stock equipment, without any additional tuning, spare parts, or custom features. 
The rear passenger windows and rear window have tinting.

In Ukraine, a tow hitch was installed as an additional feature. However, it did not cause any issues during the 
technical inspection here. 

The car was imported as personal goods, and therefore, no custom taxes were paid. The place of registration was Berlin.

It is worthwhile to mention that the cars like mine generally meet the EU norms for lighting equipment, mirrors, 
and other requirements. However, there may be a different situation for popular ukrainian trend, such as buying used 
and damaged cars from the USA, repairing them, and registering them in Ukraine. While I cannot speak from experience 
about registering such cars in Germany, I recommend this article from someone who registered their 
US Subaru as a [reference](http://crankydriver.com/word/are-you-tuv-enough-2){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
