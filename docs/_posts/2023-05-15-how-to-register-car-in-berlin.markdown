### Preface
If you've ever found yourself driving through Germany with a car registered in a non-EU country, you may have 
encountered the daunting task of legalizing it. While there are countless guides online that offer vague advice 
such as get a ***CoC from the dealer*** or pass a ***technical inspection at TÃœV***, 
these resources often leave you with more questions than answers. These tips are not particularly helpful when you 
don't know where to start or what to expect.

In this article, I aim to provide a detailed account of my own experience with car registration in Germany. 
Rather than simply explaining the theoretical process, I'll provide concrete examples of what to do, 
including which documents to prepare, what they should look like, which authorities to visit, and what you can 
expect as a result. 

Certainly, each experience is unique, and your case may differ from mine. It's important to note that my experience 
with car registration in Germany was specific to my circumstances (let's call it the context), 
which I will outline below.

### Context
I have registered a ***Mazda 6 GJ*** with a diesel engine, which was previously imported into Ukraine by 
an official importer. The car has its stock equipment, without any additional tuning, spare parts, or custom features. 
The rear passenger windows and rear window have tinting.

In Ukraine, a tow hitch was installed as an additional feature. However, it did not cause any issues during the 
technical inspection here. 

The car was imported ***as personal goods***, and therefore, no custom taxes were paid. 
The place of registration was ***Berlin***.

It is worthwhile to mention that the cars like mine generally meet the EU norms for lighting equipment, mirrors, 
and other requirements. However, there may be a different situation for popular ukrainian trend, such as buying used 
and damaged cars from the USA, repairing them, and registering them in Ukraine. While I cannot speak from experience 
about registering such cars in Germany, I recommend this article from someone who ***registered their 
US Subaru*** as a [reference](http://crankydriver.com/word/are-you-tuv-enough-2){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

### What you need to take care in the origin country
When registering your car in Berlin, there are two important documents you will need to obtain from your origin 
country: ***proof of accident-free driving history*** from your insurance company (if applicable) and 
a ***Certificate of Conformity*** (CoC) for your car from the official car importer. Let's delve into these 
documents in more detail.

In Germany, there is a system known as ***Schadenfreiheitsklasse*** or ***SF-Klasse*** for short, which translates to 
***no-claim class***. 

The SF-Klasse represents the number of years without any accidents or the accident history 
associated with your insurance policy. A driver who has recently obtained their license or has no prior insurance 
history will have an SF class of 0. 

This means that their ***insurance premium*** or ***Beitragssatz*** will be 
above 100%, indicating that they have to pay the full insurance cost without any discounts. 

As a new driver, it is highly likely that you will be classified under this category. The longer you drive without 
any accidents, the higher your SF-Klasse becomes, and the cheaper your insurance costs will be (up to a maximum of SF 35). 
Each accident-free year leads to a decrease in the insurance cost, starting  from 100%. For instance, in your first 
year of accident-free driving, you can gain an SF class of 1, resulting in a decrease in insurance costs to a 
range of 65%-100%. Here is how my insurer [describes this things](https://www.huk24.de/autoversicherung/kfz-ratgeber/schadenfreiheitsklasse){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.  

Transferring your SF-Klasse from another German insurance company or even from an insurance company in the EU is 
relatively straightforward. Some insurance companies are willing to accept proof of accident-free driving experience 
from non-EU countries, including Ukraine. If, for example, you have had five accident-free years in Ukraine, you can 
apply for an SF-Klasse of 4 (as far as I understand, from 0 to 4, which is 5 years in total), allowing you to save 
some money on your insurance premiums.

Fortunately, I was fortunate enough to have been using only one insurance company, ***ARX***, from 2018 to 2022. 
This made it easier for me to write a letter to [their customer support](https://arx.com.ua/kontakty){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} 
and inquire about the necessary proof. They promptly responded, [requesting an application](/assets/files/how_to_register_car_in_berlin/c3_request_for_accident_free_soot_confirmation.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, 
my identification code, and passport information. 

After a few weeks, I received the ***confirmation***, which I then forwarded to the German insurance company as required:

![Response for accident free soot confirmation](/assets/images/how_to_register_car_in_berlin/c3_response_for_accident_free_soot_confirmation.png "Response for accident free soot confirmation")

During the confirmation process, I was given the option to request a hard copy. 
I agreed and asked my friend in Ukraine if he could receive it in his mailbox. Although I'm unsure if he actually 
received anything as almost a month has passed, I can confidently say that the electronic version sufficed 
in my situation. My insurance company accepted the document, categorized me as an 4 SF-Klasse driver, and 
recalculated my contract accordingly. As a result, I was able to save approximately 30% on the contract price. 
Given the outcome, I would definitely recommend giving it a try.

Another important aspect that can help you save money is obtaining a CoC. This document serves as proof that the 
vehicle you own meets all the necessary technical requirements for ***EC Whole Vehicle Type Approval*** (EC-WVTA) 
at the time of its production. A car with a CoC is considered homologated for the European Union, 
and this certificate holds validity in all EU Member States. Consequently, with a CoC, 
you can register your car in any EU country.

The CoC document contains crucial information about the vehicle, including its identification data 
(such as ***make***, ***type/variant/version***, ***commercial name***, and ***VIN***), the name of the 
vehicle manufacturer, the EC-WVTA number, and specific details regarding the vehicle's specifications and 
characteristics (such as ***dimensions***, ***masses***, ***capacities***, and ***color***). Additionally, 
it includes the official test results for ***noise***, ***exhaust emissions***, and ***fuel consumption*** 
conducted in accordance with EU standards. Essentially, the CoC provides a comprehensive description of your car.

To the best of my knowledge, when purchasing a newly manufactured car, the Certificate of Conformity (CoC) is typically 
included in the document set provided upon signing the contract. However, this may not always be the case if you have 
owned the car for a while or, as in my situation, purchased an aftermarket car. In my case, I did not receive such 
a certificate initially, but I will provide more detailed information about my experience later in this article. 
As a general recommendation, I advise you to inquire about the CoC with your dealer.

If you own a Mazda in Ukraine, like myself, you can contact [the official dealer](https://mazda.com.ua/mazda-na-pochaini/contacts){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} for assistance.
I had to make two attempts to reach them, as the first employee informed me that they could not issue the 
certificate for my car. However, the second employee had a better understanding of their dealership's procedures and 
directed me to the person responsible for issuing such documents. Since I don't want to disclose any personal details 
here, it's possible that there are specific employees assigned to handle CoCs. Therefore, it is important to first 
contact the dealer and be persistent. Now you can be certain that they have the capability to provide the CoC.

### Customs clearance
Due to uncertainties surrounding the registration process of my car, such as potential missing documents or technical 
limitations (such as the suitability of a diesel engine for Germany), I decided to approach the steps in a 
cost-effective manner. The first step, which doesn't require any financial investment, is the customs clearance.
Upon permanently relocating to Germany, I had the opportunity to bring along personal belongings. To my surprise, 
I discovered that the car qualifies as a personal item, similar to my laptop, clothes, and two bicycles 
(refer to the section on "private vehicles of any kind" from [more details](https://www.zoll.de/EN/Private-individuals/Staying-in-Germany/Transferring-residence/transferring-residence_node.html){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}). 
Consequently, no taxes need to be paid during the clearance process.

Prior to custom visiting you need to fill the [custom declaration](https://www.formulare-bfinv.de/ffw/action/invoke.do?id=0350)
(so called form 0350), which is quite easy to do. There is also an [english version](https://www.zoll.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/FormulareMerkblaetter/Private-individuals/Staying-in-Germany/0350_2021_uebersetzungshilfe_en.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=6) 
of the declaration, which you can use for wrapping yourself out what each item mean. I've prepared an example for you 
with Marty on the main role:

![Customs declaration](/assets/images/how_to_register_car_in_berlin/c3_custom_clearance_0350_1.png "Customs declaration")

![Customs declaration](/assets/images/how_to_register_car_in_berlin/c3_custom_clearance_0350_2.png "Customs declaration")

You may notice that the form consists of six pages. However, don't be alarmed! In our example, we will focus on 
filling in the required information on just two pages. The remaining pages are duplicates intended for different 
individuals involved in the customs process, and they will be automatically completed. Let's delve into the specific 
details of each paragraph to ensure a clear understanding of the form.

- Personal Information (2). In this section, you are required to provide your personal details, 
including your first and last name, current address in Germany (where you will register), and your mobile phone number;

 - Date of Relocation (3). Here, you need to enter the date of your relocation. It is recommended to use the date 
stamped on your passport when you crossed the EU border;

 - Address in the Country of Origin (4). This paragraph requires you to provide your address in the country 
you are relocating from;

 - Confirmation of Residency (6).  In this section, you are confirming that you have resided outside the EU customs 
territory for at least one year. If this applies to you, toggle the corresponding option. You may be asked for 
evidence, such as rental contracts, but it is worth noting that in my case, no proof was requested;

 - Main Residence and Vehicle Information (8). By selecting this option, you are agreeing that your main residence 
will be in Germany within six months. If you already have a residence in Germany, toggle this item accordingly. 
Additionally, you need to provide the value of your car, which can be obtained from your Ukrainian car sales 
contract. Convert the value from hryvnias to euros using the exchange rate of the National Bank of Ukraine on that 
particular day. It is important to note that in my experience, no supporting documents were requested for this 
information;

 - Description of Car (10). In this paragraph, you need to provide detailed information about the goods that exceed 
the value of 5000 euros. Since your car likely falls under this category, include the car plate number, model, 
model year, and VIN code;

 - Personal Use of Car (15). Here, you must indicate that the goods, specifically your car, are for personal use 
only and not for business purposes;

 - Certificate request (16). This is a crucial item on the form. By selecting this option, you are stating that 
you require a certificate confirming that the customs office has no objections to registering your car.

Remember, while some supporting documents may be requested, my personal experience demonstrates that not all details 
require extensive proof.
